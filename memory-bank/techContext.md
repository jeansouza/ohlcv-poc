# Technical Context: OHLCV-POC

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side
- **TypeScript**: Typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript
- **Fastify**: Fast and low overhead web framework for Node.js
- **InfluxDB**: Purpose-built time series database

### Development Tools
- **npm**: Package manager for JavaScript
- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework with a focus on simplicity
- **ESLint**: Static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns
- **Prettier**: Opinionated code formatter
- **ts-node**: TypeScript execution environment and REPL for Node.js
- **nodemon**: Utility that monitors for changes and automatically restarts the server

### Testing Tools
- **Jest**: For unit testing
- **Supertest**: For HTTP assertions and integration testing
- **TestContainers**: For spinning up Docker containers during testing
- **Istanbul/nyc**: For code coverage reporting

### Documentation Tools
- **TypeDoc**: Documentation generator for TypeScript projects
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: API documentation
- **Markdown**: For general documentation

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm (v8 or later)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for running InfluxDB locally)
- Git

### Local Development Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start InfluxDB with Docker Compose
4. Run the development server with `npm run dev`
5. Run tests with `npm test`

## Technical Constraints

### Performance Requirements
- Must be able to generate and write 300 million trade records
- Batch processing should be optimized for InfluxDB
- Memory usage should be carefully managed to prevent out-of-memory errors
- Processing time should be reasonable (specific targets to be determined)

### Scalability Considerations
- The solution should demonstrate patterns that would work at even larger scales
- Horizontal scaling should be considered in the design, even if not implemented
- Resource usage should be monitored and documented

### Compatibility Requirements
- Must work with InfluxDB 2.x
- Should follow InfluxDB best practices for data modeling and writing
- Should use the official InfluxDB client library

### Security Considerations
- Secure handling of InfluxDB credentials
- Input validation for all API endpoints
- Proper error handling to prevent information leakage

## External Dependencies

### InfluxDB
- **Version**: 2.x
- **Configuration**: 
  - Organization: "ohlcv-poc"
  - Bucket: "trades"
  - Retention policy: 10 years (configurable)
- **Connection**: HTTP API via official client library

### Docker
- Used for running InfluxDB in development and testing
- Docker Compose configuration provided for easy setup

## Performance Benchmarks
- Initial benchmarks to be established
- Regular performance testing to track improvements
- Documentation of performance characteristics under different conditions

## Monitoring and Observability
- Logging with structured JSON format
- Performance metrics collection
- Resource usage tracking (CPU, memory, network)
- Batch processing statistics
