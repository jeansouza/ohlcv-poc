# Product Context: OHLCV-POC

## Problem Statement
Financial applications often need to process and analyze large volumes of trade data. Storing and retrieving this data efficiently is a common challenge. Time series databases like InfluxDB are designed for this purpose, but implementing an efficient data ingestion pipeline requires careful consideration of performance, reliability, and data integrity.

## Solution
This proof of concept demonstrates a high-performance data ingestion pipeline for trade data using Node.js, TypeScript, and InfluxDB. By generating and storing 300 million synthetic trade records, we can evaluate:

1. The performance characteristics of InfluxDB for large-scale financial data
2. Efficient patterns for bulk data writing
3. Optimal data modeling for trade information
4. Resource requirements for high-volume data ingestion

## User Experience Goals
As a technical proof of concept, the primary users are developers and system architects who need to:

1. Understand how to efficiently write large volumes of trade data to InfluxDB
2. Evaluate the performance characteristics of the solution
3. Adapt the patterns demonstrated for their specific use cases
4. Learn best practices for time series data management in financial applications

## Success Criteria
The project will be considered successful if it:

1. Successfully generates and stores 300 million trade records in InfluxDB
2. Demonstrates measurable and reproducible performance metrics
3. Provides clear documentation on the implementation approach
4. Achieves 100% test coverage with comprehensive test cases
5. Establishes reusable patterns for time series data management

## Key Workflows

### Data Generation Workflow
1. Define a set of common stock symbols to use
2. Generate random but realistic trade data (price, amount, side)
3. Distribute timestamps across the year 2024
4. Ensure data volume meets the 300 million record requirement

### Data Ingestion Workflow
1. Prepare data in the format required by InfluxDB
2. Implement efficient batching for optimal write performance
3. Handle potential errors and retries
4. Track and report on ingestion progress and performance

### Verification Workflow
1. Confirm all records were successfully written
2. Validate data integrity through sampling
3. Measure and report on performance metrics
4. Document findings and recommendations
