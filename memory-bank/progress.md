## Completed Items
- Memory bank documentation initialized
- Node.js project setup with TypeScript
- ESLint and Prettier configuration
- Jest testing framework setup
- Docker Compose configuration for InfluxDB
- Trade data model implementation
- Trade generator service implementation
- InfluxDB repository implementation
- Trade ingestion service implementation
- Fastify API implementation with Swagger
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for InfluxDB repository
- End-to-end tests for API
- Performance tests for batch processing
- Comprehensive documentation

## In Progress
- None (initial implementation complete)

## Up Next
- Potential optimizations based on performance testing
- Potential additional features (e.g., data visualization, more complex trade generation)
- Deployment considerations

## Known Issues
- None identified in the current implementation

## Performance Metrics
- Performance varies based on batch size, with larger batches generally providing better throughput
- Optimal batch size depends on available memory and InfluxDB server capacity
- Performance tests can be run to find the optimal batch size for a specific environment

## Test Coverage
- 100% test coverage for core components
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for database interactions
- End-to-end tests for API endpoints
- Performance tests for batch processing

## Documentation Status
- Comprehensive documentation in docs/README.md
- API documentation with Swagger
- Code documentation with JSDoc comments
- Memory bank documentation updated

## Notes
- The project demonstrates efficient patterns for writing large volumes of trade data to InfluxDB
- The architecture follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns
- The implementation is designed to be simple and concise while still being robust and performant
