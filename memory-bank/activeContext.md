# Active Context: OHLCV-POC

## Current Focus
We are at the initial setup phase of the OHLCV-POC project. The primary focus is to establish the project structure, set up the development environment, and implement the core functionality for generating and writing trade data to InfluxDB.

## Recent Decisions

1. **Project Structure**: 
   - Following a modular, domain-driven design approach
   - Separating concerns between data generation, transformation, and storage
   - Using a clean architecture pattern with clear boundaries between layers

2. **Development Approach**:
   - Test-driven development (TDD) to ensure 100% test coverage
   - Incremental implementation with regular performance testing
   - Documentation-first approach for all components
   - Strict TypeScript usage with no bypassing of the compiler
   - Properly addressing TypeScript errors rather than working around them

3. **Performance Strategy**:
   - Batch processing for efficient InfluxDB writes
   - Memory management through stream processing where appropriate
   - Configurable batch sizes to find optimal performance

## Current Tasks

1. **Project Initialization**:
   - Set up Node.js project with TypeScript
   - Configure ESLint, Prettier, and other development tools
   - Set up Jest for testing
   - Create initial documentation structure

2. **Core Implementation**:
   - Define trade data model
   - Implement trade data generator
   - Set up InfluxDB connection and writer
   - Create basic API endpoints with Fastify

3. **Testing Setup**:
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests for database interactions
   - End-to-end tests for the complete workflow
   - Performance tests for batch processing

4. **Documentation**:
   - API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
   - Setup and installation instructions
   - Component documentation with TypeDoc
   - Performance benchmarking documentation

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Initialize the Node.js project with TypeScript
2. Set up the development environment with necessary dependencies
3. Create Docker Compose configuration for InfluxDB
4. Implement the basic trade data model
5. Set up the testing framework with Jest

## Open Questions

1. What is the optimal batch size for writing to InfluxDB?
2. How should we distribute the 300 million trades across the year 2024?
3. What specific stock symbols should we use for the synthetic data?
4. What performance metrics should we track and report?
